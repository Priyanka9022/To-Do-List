# To-Do-List
A To-Do List using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Itâ€™s a simple yet effective tool for managing tasks or keeping track of things to do. This project is a great way to learn how to combine front-end technologies to create interactive and functional web applications.
